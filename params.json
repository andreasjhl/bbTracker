{"name":"bbTracker","tagline":"A simple GPS tracker for Java-enabled phones","body":"### bbTracker\r\nbbTracker is a simple application for Java-enabled smartphones to create GPS track logs. It tracks ones movement and provides that data for later analysis. It is not meant as a replacement for full-featured GPS software that does display maps and do path-finding, but rather a simple tool that does one thing and does it well.\r\n\r\nThis software is archived here and is no longer actively developed. Please note that this will **not** run on modern Android-based smartphones or BlackBerry phones with the BlackBerry 10 operating system. It's for Java ME enabled phones only (sometimes called \"J2ME\").\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-42904822-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
