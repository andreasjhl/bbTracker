# bbTracker

bbTracker is a simple application for Java-enabled smartphones to create GPS 
track logs.

It tracks ones movement and provides that data for later analysis. It is not 
meant as a replacement for full-featured GPS software that does display maps 
and do path-finding, but rather a simple tool that does one thing and does it
well.
